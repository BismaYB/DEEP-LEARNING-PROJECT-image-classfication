# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT-image-classfication

## Image Classification using TensorFlow

üìå Project Overview

This project builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify images into categories. 
The model is trained on a dataset with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deployed 
using Flask or FastAPI.
This project implements an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Model Architecture

‚úîÔ∏è Convolutional Layers (Feature extraction)
‚úîÔ∏è MaxPooling Layers (Dimensionality reduction)
‚úîÔ∏è Dense Layers (Classification)
‚úîÔ∏è Dropout (Prevents overfitting)

### Features & Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Normalization, augmentation, and dataset loading.
CNN Model Architecture: Feature extraction using convolutional and pooling layers.
Training & Evaluation: Model training with accuracy and loss visualization.
Deployment: API for real-time image classification using Flask/FastAPI.

## Model Evaluation & Results

The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Performance is visualized using plots for training and validation accuracy/loss.
Possible improvements include fine-tuning hyperparameters or using transfer learning for better accuracy.

## Deployment

The trained model is integrated into a web-based API, allowing users to upload an image and receive a classification prediction.
The API is designed for easy integration into applications requiring automated image recognition.
